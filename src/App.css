/*
  ✅ FIXES APPLIED:
  1. Removed `padding: 2rem` from #root — this was causing the ~32px gap all
     around every section making cards look "floating" on the background.
  2. Removed `max-width: 1280px` from #root — this was restricting the layout
     width so the html/body background colour bled through on both sides.
  3. Set `text-align: left` (was `center`) so child components handle their
     own alignment rather than being force-centered by the root.
  Individual components that need centering use `mx-auto` or `text-center`
  on their own containers, which is the correct approach.
